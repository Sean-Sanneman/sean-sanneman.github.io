    <p>
        He wakes at dawn - the pale hand of an autumn sun caressing the rooftops of the city - cars speak in smoke signals of exhaust, ankle high in their delivery, atmospheric in implication - the right side of his foot brushes against a container of last night’s entertainment, once trapped in a small can - now resting in the belly of a vagrant
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        At 7am, the streets of Budapest are like a frozen image of several different histories intertwining to complete Picasso’s last Silent masterpiece - women in tight black leather chase moments of stardom while on their way to their daily sustenance - Cubicles await fingertips - Ovens await bread - and old heads attempt to learn foreign languages
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        Nothing is said as he enters the worm - an old gypsy lady squished between the hand rail and sliding door seems more like a Copperfieldesque postcard than a vertebrate - she yells at her child - tells him to stop climbing the walls, and pretend for a minute, that we live in a civilized world - the worm begins the next leg of its journey
        </p> </br>

        <p>
        While crossing the river, history flows in a non-stop collage of architecture – St. Istvan smiles down from his title of grandeur on the millions of souls captivated by multiple attempts at design – every idea built – it’s as if one can see the calluses of the sculptor as he etches his image upon the facade of future generations – the bridge is heavy with construction, and the laundering of money
        </p> </br>
        <p> 
        Everything has an opposite – rich mingle with poor – drunkards with businessmen –  clowns tap-dance rhythms to the sound of the grim-reaper playing a nyenyere, his feathered hat blowing in the wind of October – no one speaks – and yet, everyone is talking, typing, sending, receiving – the world is one colossal fiber optic-wire – we are all connected – we are all alone
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        The worm stops at the end of the bridge – opens the right side of its mid-section – passengers step out into the morning gray, searching for the next worm to carry them onward – daily duties call – the towering spires of ancient buildings stand erect, forgotten 
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        The controller comes out from her hiding place,  armband displayed – hands fumble through pocketbooks and purses, searching for documentation – her eyes glazed over by the mundane routine of her morning obligations – she checks each person - thanks them for not attacking her – exits in silence
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        He watches as again they enter into an urban cavity between two walls of not quite victorian buildings – beside him, a homeless man is chatting with an imaginary boy – they speak in Eddic prose, about the final resting place of the scourge of god – the changing of time permanently marked upon his forehead – the child’s voiceless laughter painting a smile across the old man’s gnarled expressions
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        Motion gives way to rest – he steps out into the sound of footsteps rushing in a myriad of directions – lights flash colors, signaling for patience – but no one heeds the call – they check for approaching danger – crossing intersections at their own discretion - a simple truth found within a disregard for rules – in the arms of an ancient civilization people live without interference
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        He pauses to observe his surroundings – statue stonework stares down at him – the smell of fresh pastry tickling the senses – there is a veil of renovation covering the building to the right – and a bus has stopped on the left, waiting for its orders – the screeching sound of taxi-tires reminds him that death could come in a moment’s notice – he decides it’s safe to cross – beneath a red-light he walks, cautiously forward 
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        Ahead, the curved road has been uncovered to reveal the fertile soil that remains hidden beneath the infrastructure of the city – where once paprika grew in abundance, land waits for concealment – workers enjoy their morning pálinka – and cars strive to avoid complications
    </p> </br>
        <p>
        He enters a place of business – a box moving in vertical increments,   guarded by a young girl in soldier-like adornment – she’s seen him before – punches a button – a noise beckons him to enter, as he makes his ascent upward – above, students wait for instruction – their eyes elated at his arrival – the hardest part of the day has come to an end
